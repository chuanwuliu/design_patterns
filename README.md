# Python demonstrations to software design patterns

Author: Chuanwu (Charles) Liu

This repository includes introduction and demonstrations to software design patterns in Python.
The demonstrations are based on my presentations at the tech session of Global Kinetics Corporation.

Three types of design patterns are included in this demonstration:
  * Creational patterns. Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code
  * Structural patterns. Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping this structures flexible and efficient.
  * Behavioral patterns: Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects
