    "  * An invoker object knows how to execute a command, and optionally does bookkeeping about the command execution. The invoker does not know anything about a concrete command, it knows only about the command interface.\n",
    "  * Invoker objects, command objects and receiver objects are held by a client object, the client decides which receiver objects it assigns to the command objects, and which commands it assigns to the invoker. The client decides which commands to execute at which points. To execute a command, it passes the command object to the invoker object."

    "\n",
    "The object that has some interesting state is often called subject, The subject is also called it publisher since it’s going to notify other objects about the changes to its state. All other objects that want to track changes to the publisher’s state are called subscribers or observers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "  1. Add a subscription mechanism to the publisher:\n",
    "    * An list field for storing a list of subscribers\n",
    "    * Several public methods which allow adding and removing subscribers from that list.\n",
